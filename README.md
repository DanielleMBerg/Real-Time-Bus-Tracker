# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Tracks the location of Bus Route 70 of the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority. 

The basics of the code was provided to me by my MIT course. I refactored the code to create seperate CSS, JS, and HTML files and to link to a new API. Linking to the new API required me to update the code with the new data and array key/value pairs. I also added style to the webpage (color, text, border).

## How to Run
To run on your own device, download all the files (except for the LICENSE file and the README file) and save them in one folder. Open the index.html document in your browser to view the bus tracker live!

## Future Improvements
A few improvments that may be helpful would be: adding more routes to the map, and incluiding time estimates of when the bus will arrive at a bus stop.
